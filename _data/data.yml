career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My first experience of working an IT job was with a private IT company
      which I still work to this very day as a part-timer. Currently as a web designer, the frontend end has definitely interested me more than the backend. Down the line I would
      like to further expand upon that, and perhaps find more interests. As a youth I also used to work a summer job in a restaurant located in Paleokastritsa, Corfu, Greece.
education:
    - degree: Undergraduate Student
      university: Ionian University, Department of Informatics
      time: 2019 - Present
      details: |
        Even though many other options presented themselves, I opted to study in Ionian University due to both its location (since I'm a local) and because of its great 
        curriculum and possibilities it provides. So far I've gravitated towards bringing humanistic studies in my studies, introducing elements of computer design and 
        the interaction between human and computer, as well as how humans act and interact with both themselves and computers. Main interests include:
          - Web and Computere design
          - Graphical Interfaces
          - Human Computer Interaction
          - Networking
experiences:
    - role: Intern
      time: 2021 - Present
      company: Webits, Corfu
      details: |
        I work as an intern, often undertaking many projects geared around web designing, mostly via the use of CSS, HTML and PHP. I'm still learning many things on the specifics!
    - role: Waitor
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: Nereids Restaurant, Corfu
      details: |
        Worked during the summer months of 2019 and 2020, giving me more insight about how a workplace environment operates. Got to meet many people, polish my social skills
        and acquired many interesting experiences. Learned a couple of bar tricks too!
projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      I don't particularly have any projects, considering that what I've done for the most part is through the company, but I have worked on a university project with a fellow student.
      Technically still in progress, it is a visual novel game using Ren'Py, where I undertook some roles including character design, management of said project, and fleshing out
      parts of the dialogue and code.
