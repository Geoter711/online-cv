Profile}{    Career Profile}}\label{career-profile}}

My first experience of working an IT job was with a private IT company
which I still work to this very day as a part-timer. Currently as a web
designer, the frontend end has definitely interested me more than the
backend. Down the line I would like to further expand upon that, and
perhaps find more interests. As a youth I also used to work a summer job
in a restaurant located in Paleokastritsa, Corfu, Greece.

2019 - Present

Ionian University, Department of Informatics

Even though many other options presented themselves, I opted to study in
Ionian University due to both its location (since I'm a local) and
because of its great curriculum and possibilities it provides. So far
I've gravitated towards bringing humanistic studies in my studies,
introducing elements of computer design and the interaction between
human and computer, as well as how humans act and interact with both
themselves and computers. Main interests include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Web and Computere design
\item
  Graphical Interfaces
\item
  Human Computer Interaction
\item
  Networking

2021 - Present

Webits, Corfu

I work as an intern, often undertaking many projects geared around web
designing, mostly via the use of CSS, HTML and PHP. I'm still learning
many things on the specifics!

\subsubsection{Waitor}\label{waitor}}

2019 - 2020

Nereids Restaurant, Corfu

Worked during the summer months of 2019 and 2020, giving me more insight
about how a workplace environment operates. Got to meet many people,
polish my social skills and acquired many interesting experiences.
Learned a couple of bar tricks too!

\hypertarget{projects}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{{ \emph{} \emph{} }
Projects}{    Projects}}\label{projects}}

I don't particularly have any projects, considering that what I've done
for the most part is through the company, but I have worked on a
university project with a fellow student. Technically still in progress,
it is a visual novel game using Ren'Py, where I undertook some roles
including character design, management of said project, and fleshing out
parts of the dialogue and code.
